						<p><strong>My story in a nutshell</strong></p>
						<p>Having left family and a steady job back home with nothing more than a backpack and duffel bag,
							I could say that I have never been more prepared and determined in my life to make things work.
							<br><br>
							Why?
							<br><br>
							Because I embrace the fact that I know very little.
							<br><br>
							Not just about coding, but about life and the world around me. Growing up, I hardly traveled out of state. My first time on a plane was when I was 20; my first time out of the country was when I was 22. But in the past year, I decided to just go out and travel more because frankly, I hardly knew how to use the Metro or follow grid systems and figured that it was about time I developed some street knowledge for my own good. 
							<br><br>
							Since then, I've managed to travel to New York, Chicago, and have gone solo couchsurfing up and down the coast of California, all on my own time and on my own expenses. While saving up for a bit longer may have been nice, the money saved could not have possibly measured up to the invaluable experiences I've had and the incredible people I've met by allowing myself to be exposed and vulnerable.
							<br><br>
							Because I don't plan on being a starving artist.
							<br><br>
							Despite the fact that I'm handling my daunting student loans on my own, I left my job in order to attend Dev Bootcamp, which resulted in yet another loan. 
							<br><br>
							Rather than take the backseat during the development process, I wanted to immerse myself in the realm of coding so that I could actually be the person transforming my imaginative ideas into something perceivable and tangible. Coding does more than provide me with a creative outlet; it provides me with a way to pay off loans while having fun in the process. But on a more serious note, it provides me with a means of engaging with other people through my work and imagination.

						<strong class="patreon-orange-txt">Whatsup and welcome to my page!</strong>
						<br><br>
						My name's Harvey, and I'm 23 years old. As a dancer and developer, I have a passion for making and breaking things. I'm currently living in San Francisco while on a journey to become a web developer. At the same time, I'm doing what I can to get by and stay involved in the amazing dance community out here in the Bay Area. I'm passionate about house dancing and popping, but I'm always looking to expand my dance vocabulary!
						<br>
						Help me help you by being a patron of my quest to be a patron for Patreon!
					</p>
					<p><strong class="patreon-orange-txt">Why apply to Patreon?</strong></p>

					<p>There's a lot of reasons, really. I'm a huge fan of the idea behind crowdfunding and supporting other creators. I don't believe in working your whole life at a 9-5 you don't like to pay off loans (even though I really should be focusing on getting a job ASAP to pay off my own), and I think that the words starving and artist should never be paired together.
						<br><br>
						Working at Patreon would be a way for me to work on supporting my own journey towards becoming a web developer, and it would also be a way for me to help like-minded people who  are beginning to take risks for their own careers as well. Being able to help others is something I truly live for, because you can't help but feel good when you see someone make progress towards their goals, let alone play a part in it.
						<br><br>
						One of my proudest achievements includes starting a dance organization called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/themighty.uva/">The Mighty</a> at my university with some friends. The sole purpose was to help foster a dance community where people with and without experience could have an outlet to exchange and grow with one another. I'm proud to say that it's still standing today, and it's crazy to see how some of our first active members are now a part of the Executive Board. I'd like to continue working on fostering other creative communities with Patreon, and I would love to work on bringing more dancers and theater artists into the Patreon community!</p>

						<p><strong class="patreon-orange-txt">Sound too good to be true?</strong></p>
						<p>
							Well I'm a bad liar, so if I was lying you'd know by now! I promise that you won't find someone as passionate and enthusiastic about developing, dancing, and supporting the community as me! And besides, we all know what'll happen if I'm caught lying.. But seriously, I won't, I mean.. Dev Bootcamp has made me well aware of Impostor Syndrome and I'm doing everything I can to make sure I don't have it!
						</p>
						<p><strong class="patreon-orange-txt">So how does this work?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Oh, you're finally here! Well, here's the best part. YOU are the one who gets to decide where we go from here! You can call or email me, or better yet, ask to meet me in person! Oh, and did I mention that it literally costs nothing to get in touch?</p>
					</div>
					<div class="white-bg" id="an-iDeer">
						<p><strong class="patreon-orange-txt">Tell me more about this dance &amp; theatre idea..</strong></p>
						<p>Gladly.</p>
						<p>The performing arts community is just huge. And dancers travel internationally to attend and teach workshops. Although there's sites like Periscope.tv and YouTube that allow people to have livestreams and upload dance tutorial videos, the experience is not quite the same. But what if dancers were able to also teach classes from the comfort of their own home? It'd be pretty sweet.
						</p>
						<p>The thing about workshops is that they can get pretty dang expensive, even if you're buying the package deals. That, and not everyone wants to be around sweaty people. OR, people simply might not be able to travel to where the workshops are being held for whatever reason. There are quite a handful of dancers who teach online classes, one of instructors, Jardy Santiago, has an online course and has been pretty successful himself. You can even check out his recent video that highlights one of his online student's experiences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R648bbnUQ34">here</a>! 
						</p>
						<p>If you think about it, this idea could catch on to dancers who already have made a name for themselves. And all it really takes is one big name to start a wave in the dance community for things to start picking up. So, what do you think?
						</p>

						<p><strong class="patreon-orange-txt">So.. pledges?</strong></p>
						<p>I don't want to make an empty pledges promises before we actually meet in person, because how else are we supposed to make a pinky promise? In the meantime, check out some of the dance videos I'm in below!
